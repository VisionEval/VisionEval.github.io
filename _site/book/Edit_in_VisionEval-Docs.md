# Do not edit here

Edit these files in [VisionEval-Docs](https://github.com/VisionEval/VisionEval-Docs/tree/master/concept_primer), not here in the VisionEval.org repository.

When commits are pushed to that repository, the content here will be updated. 

This method uses a [`GitHub Workflow`](https://github.com/VisionEval/VisionEval-Docs/actions/workflows/copy_book_to_org.yml) to copy the contents os the `book` directory from VisionEval-Docs to VisionEval.org.
