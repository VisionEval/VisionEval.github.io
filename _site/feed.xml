GreenSTEP models the consequences of changes in many different factors (such as transportation supply, prices, and land use) on household vehicle ownership and use, and the resulting effects on emissions, traffic congestion, and other outcomes. It’s strength is in the ability to incorporate significant detail through modeling a synthetic set of individual households and associated vehicles and fuels, incorporating a budget model for pricing policies, while avoiding network details that lead to long run times.  GreenSTEP, a statewide model with county and metro area “zones”, has been used to establish long-range goals and identify the possible strategies to achieve these goals, such as reducing transportation related emissions by a certain percent, or ensuring that a certain percent of households live in walkable neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design concepts in GreenSTEP are the cornerstone of the related models. As a strategic planning model, GreenSTEP sits between sketch planning models that operate using simplified rule-based methods use, and modeling each individual’s daily trips by purpose on a detailed network with interacting policies. . GreenSTEP and the other VisionEval models simulate individual households and interactions between policies, but forecasts only overall travel based on metropolitan-wide travel conditions rather than detailed networks, striking a balance between rapid computation of alternative scenarios and accurate representations of how different types of households will change travel behavior in response to policies and investments. These models allow rapid analysis of how actions may interact, such as how urban area density may interact with electric vehicle ownership or car sharing. They can also test how household behavior may respond to policy changes, for instance how VMT may change in response to future increases in fuel cost or tighter budgets during stagnant economic times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inputs to GreenSTEP are similar to what is required for the other VisionEval models. These can be summarized into household characteristics (age mix, household size, personal income, dwelling type), vehicle characteristics (fuel economy, vehicle age, powertrain type), and place characteristics (density, amount of transit service, mixed use development). Given these attributes, the model estimates outputs such as household travel, travel costs, emissions, and road congestion and environmental impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;current-status&quot;&gt;Current Status&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GreenSTEP continues to be used as a State-wide planning tool by ODOT, but is not available on a public repository currently. The FHWA maintains the similar statewide Energy and Emissions Reduction Policy Analysis Tool (EERPAT) model.  EERPAT has just made a significant enhancement to add a freight model and associated policies built on FHWA Freight Analysis Framework commodity flow data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The models developed for GreenSTEP form the core of all VisionEval models. Following the successful transfer of RSPM and RPAT to the VisionEval project, Oreon DOT (and Maryland DOT) are leading the transfer of statewide GreenSTEP to VisionEval, via a contract led by CH2M Hill with sub-consultants RSG, Inc. and the original GreenSTEP author of Oregon Systems Analytics.  A VEGreenSTEP model should greatly facilitate transferring EERPAT to VisionEval.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="models" /><summary type="html">Overview of the GreenSTEP model.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://visioneval.org/%7B%22feature%22=%3Enil,%20%22credit%22=%3Enil,%20%22creditlink%22=%3Enil%7D" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Regional Strategic Planning Model (RSPM) &amp;amp; Scenario Viewer</title><link href="http://visioneval.org/users/3-rspm/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Regional Strategic Planning Model (RSPM) &amp; Scenario Viewer" /><published>2018-01-01T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-01-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://visioneval.org/users/3-rspm</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://visioneval.org/users/3-rspm/">&lt;p&gt;The Regional Strategic Planning Model (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/Planning/Documents/RSPM-Quick-Summary.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RSPM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) was developed by ODOT as an offshoot of the GreenSTEP model to support metropolitan area scenario planning projects. The name reflects a broadening of the outcomes and policies for local agency use. Outcomes beyond GHG emissions requirements, such as non-motorized travel are emphasized with a focus on the types of policies and investment actions that are often implemented at the regional or local jurisdiction level. The essential steps of RSPM are similar to GreenSTEP, with a crucial difference of geographic scale. RSPM subdivides metropolitan areas into districts, which are similar to census tracts, and groups of districts, as divisions, to represent the separate policy actions of jurisdictions within the metropolitan area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interactive viewer of previously run results from hundreds or thousands of scenarios was added to RSPM.  The viewer enables learning about the impact and tradeoffs of different policy combinations, resilience under a range of conditions, and can help to catch inconsistent thinking where residents support a broad community goal but discard the specific actions available to reach it. To date, several agencies have built web-based interactive viewers around scenarios run from VisionEval tools, allowing users a way to explore the effects of various choices for their region’s future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;current-status&quot;&gt;Current Status&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RSPM model, along with a graphical user interface and output scenario viewer (similar to RSPM viewer) is actively being transferred to the common VisionEval framework by the end of 2017. The RSPM model is the first model to be transitioned to VisionEval. The front-end graphical user interface (GUI) for RSPM will serve as the GUI for the other VisionEval models. VisionEval versions of RPAT and GreenSTEP (statewide) models are funded, and expected to follow within 6-9 months. The under-development VERSPM is currently housed on a GitHub repository.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="models" /><summary type="html">Overview of the RSPM model.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://visioneval.org/%7B%22feature%22=%3Enil,%20%22credit%22=%3Enil,%20%22creditlink%22=%3Enil%7D" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Rapid Policy Analysis Tool (RPAT)</title><link href="http://visioneval.org/users/2-rpat/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Rapid Policy Analysis Tool (RPAT)" /><published>2018-01-01T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-01-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://visioneval.org/users/2-rpat</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://visioneval.org/users/2-rpat/">&lt;p&gt;The Rapid Policy Analysis Tool (&lt;a href=&quot;https://planningtools.transportation.org/551/rapid-policy-analysis-tool.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RPAT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) was developed under the federal Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP2). The model was developed to help planners evaluate the potential effect of growth policies on regional travel. Portions of the GreenSTEP model were used in RPAT, but substantial revisions were made to the code, including use of land use place type categories representing the built environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like RSPM, RPAT is built off of the GreenSTEP code for evaluating effects of scenarios at the household level, and operates on a single metropolitan region geographical level, disaggregated by land use place type. An additional distinction between RSPM and RPAT is the type of policies that are intended to be tested, and the data requirements to set up the model. RPAT is focused on smart growth and land use planning, and aims to identify the most promising polices to achieve smart growth targets. RPAT can evaluate policies which affect changes to the built environment (such as transit-oriented development and proportion of population in mixed-use areas), changes to travel demand (such as development near the urban core and changes in firm size and industry), changes in transportation supply (such as amount of regional transit service), and changes in policies (such as intelligent transportation system strategies and demand management). RPAT produces safety performance measures in addition to other travel and environmental results of RSPM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;current-status&quot;&gt;Current Status&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A VisionEval version of RPAT is under design. Following the completion of the transition of RSPM to the VisionEval framework, RPAT will be transitioned as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="models" /><summary type="html">Overview of the RPAT model.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://visioneval.org/%7B%22feature%22=%3Enil,%20%22credit%22=%3Enil,%20%22creditlink%22=%3Enil%7D" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Work Underway for all Tools</title><link href="http://visioneval.org/users/1-ongoing/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Work Underway for all Tools" /><published>2018-01-01T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-01-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://visioneval.org/users/1-ongoing</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://visioneval.org/users/1-ongoing/">&lt;p&gt;The ongoing work involves:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Outstanding work on the migration of RSPM, RPAT, and GreenSTEP to the VisionEval framework is outlined in the GitHub Wiki’s Modules &amp;amp; Packages and Roadmap pages. Once in a common framework, future enhancements of any tool should be usable by all other tools.  Such as the implementation of a module which captures multi-modal travel in VERSPM can also be used with VERPAT, as both models will use similar structures and share code.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Updated Multi-Modal travel modules were built by PSU for VERSPM through a peer-reviewed ODOT Research project (completed in June 2017), which is anticipated to be integrated into VERSPM in early 2017. See GitHub wiki’s Roadmap page.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In a pilot contributor Review Team effort completed in September 2017(documented on the GitHub wiki), a review team of agency partner, academic, and consultants reviewed industry code governance best practices, developed a VisionEval charter and review process, and piloted this process using the Multi-Modal travel modules as a test case code submittal for inclusion in the VisionEval repository. Documentation of these efforts can be found on the GitHub wiki.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ODOT’s contract also includes a couple other efforts that will continue into 2018.  These include a VisionEval Documentation Plan (including upgrades to VisionEval Developer orientation materials), and technical activities to increase the number of software developers familiar with and contributing to the VisionEval codebase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;future-enhancements&quot;&gt;Future Enhancements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VERSPM will be extended with additional modules via the pooled fund. These future enhancements are planned to be carried out in a way which can be used for RPAT and GreenSTEP as well as RSPM. A wish list of desired upgrades, reflecting agency partner priorities per an August 2016 Peer Exchange in Portland, is available at the GitHub Roadmap page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to new tool functionality, possible future enhancements might also include scenario planning support, such as case studies, reasonable ranges of various policy inputs, aids to facilitate transit and land use inputs, equity analyses, and peer review of VisionEval tools.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="models" /><category term="enhancements" /><summary type="html">Ongoing work as listed in the Development Roadmap page on GitHub.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://visioneval.org/%7B%22feature%22=%3Enil,%20%22credit%22=%3Enil,%20%22creditlink%22=%3Enil%7D" /></entry></feed>
