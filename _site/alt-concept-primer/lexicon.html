  <dt>5D built form measures {#5D}</dt>
  <dd>The five dimensions considered in designing efficient and sustainable cities include density, design, destination access, distance to transit, and diversity of the built environment. The five dimensions build upon the original 3Ds (density, diversity, and design) advanced by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361920997000096">Cervero &amp; Kockelman (1997)</a>. These measures are calculated in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Calculate4DMeasures</code> module during household synthesis.</dd>
  <dt>access time {#access-time}</dt>
  <dd>The time required to get from the origin to the vehicle (or in the case of <a href="#car-service">CarService</a>, the time for the vehicle to get to the traveler) and the time to get from the vehicle to the destination (including time to park the vehicle). These values are defined for vehicles owned  by the household and for two levels of CarService (low and high availability levels) in each Bzone. These factors are defined in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">azone_vehicle_access_times.csv</code> and used by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CalculateVehicleOperatingCost</code> module in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VETravelPerformance</code> package.</dd>

  <dt>auto operating cost {#auto-operating-cost}</dt>
  <dd>A combination of out-of-pocket and travel time costs used to estimate the cost per mile of owning and operating an automobile. These costs include fuel (energy), maintenance, tires, and repairs for all households. In addition, pollution or carbon taxes, parking charges, and pay-as-you-drive (PAYD) insurance costs are included where coded for the household’s enclosed Bzone. The costs are calculated in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CalculateHhVehicleOperatingCosts</code> module of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VETravelPerformance</code> package.</dd>
  <dd><a href="https://github.com/gregorbj/Archive-VisionEval/blob/master/sources/modules/VETravelPerformance/inst/module_docs/CalculateVehicleOperatingCost.md">Additional details</a></dd>
  <dt>auto ownership costs {#auto-ownership-costs}</dt>
  <dd>The average cost of auto ownership is calculated based upon vehicle type (automobile, light truck) and age using typical cost figures from AAA data. The cost per mile is estimated by dividing the average cost by the household daily VMT estimates produced by the model. A depreciation model is used to adjust this cost based upon the vehicle type, age, and annual miles driven (daily VMT converted into annual miles). The ownership costs represent the full costs of ownership, to include maintenance, tires, depreciation, fuel, insurance, etc.</dd>
  <dd>Auto ownership is adjusted when the per-mile cost of owning a car is higher than car service (mobility services) when the latter has high availability. This adjustment is made in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AdjustVehicleOwnership</code> module.</dd>

  <dt>auto sufficiency {#auto-sufficiency}</dt>
  <dd>Auto sufficiency is achieved when the number of vehicles available to a household is equal to or greater than the number of licensed drivers in a household. A household in “auto insufficient” when that is not true. Zero-auto households are cases where the household has access to a vehicle. In the age of ubiquitous mobility services this definition may become less important in describing mobility options open to the household.</dd>
  <dt>bus-equivalent-miles {#bus-equivalent-miles}</dt>
  <dd>The total bus revenue miles for a transit system are divided by the assumed transit vehicle type capacities to arrive at bus-equivalent miles of service.</dd>
  <dd>The total bus revenue miles for a transit system are divided by the population of the enclosing Marea(s) to compute per capita bus-equivalent miles.</dd>

  <dt>carbon intensity {#carbon-intensity}</dt>
  <dd>A emissions measure in grams of carbon dioxide equivalents per megajoule of energy. VisionEval uses a “well-to-wheels” estimate that takes into account not only the emissions resulting from the use of the fuel (“tank-to-wheels” measures) but also the carbon emissions required to produce and transport the fuel it where it is purchased by consumers. Default values are estimated from various sources in VisionEval. The user can specify different values. These values are used in several places in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VEPowertrainsAndFuels</code> package.</dd>

  <dt>CarService {#carservice}</dt>
  <dd>This is a synonym for popular ride-sharing services provided by mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) companies. They are also more commonly referred to as mobility services.</dd>
  <dt>cash-out/buy-back program {#cash-out-buy-back}</dt>
  <dd>Parking cash-out schemes are an employee benefit that enables them to accept taxable cash income in lieu of paid or subsidized parking at the workplace. The cash-out is sometimes combined with discounted transit passes in some places. It is used as an inducement to reduce commuting by auto, especially in single-occupant vehicles.</dd>
  <dd>FHWA has an <a href="https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/fhwahop12026/sec_4.htm">excellent primer on the topic</a>, while many consider Donald Shoup’s <a href="http://shoup.bol.ucla.edu/Parking%20Cash%20Out%20Report.pdf">online book</a> a definitive resource on the topic.</dd>
  <dt>Census PUMS {#census-pums}</dt>
  <dd>The Public Use Microsample (PUMS) data are anonymized long form responses from the American Community Survey (ACS) that enable custom tabulations, summaries, and visualizations. The PUMS were formerly associated with each dicennial Census of Households and Population. The samples are anonymized by assigning each to a Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) of 100,000 or more households. Several multi-dimensional summaries used in model estimation are gleaned from the PUMS that cannot be obtained from other Census data. Data indexed along these multiple dimensions permit the PUMS data to be fused with travel survey data and to create synthetic populations.</dd>
  <dd>ACS PUMS data from 2005-19 in annual increments can be accessed from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/microdata.html">PUMS website</a>. Data from 1996-2004 can be <a href="https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/pums/">accessed separately</a>.</dd>
  <dt>commercial service {#commercial-service}</dt>
  <dd>The use of vehicles by firms and government agencies for non-personal travel other than the delivery of freight. (e.g., parcel delivery, business meetings, sales calls). Both automobiles and light trucks can be used for commercial services, and are defined both in terms of <a href="#powertrain">powertrain</a> and fuel type (gasoline, diesel, or compressed natural gas).</dd>

  <dt>congestion level {#congestion-level}</dt>
  <dd>Five levels of congestion – none, moderate, heavy, severe, and extreme – are estimated within each Marea by comparing [relative roadway supply] with the aggregate level of daily VMT (demand). Lookup tables are then used to estimate average speeds and delay for freeways and arterials. The effects of four standard operations programs (freeway ramp metering and incident management, arterial signal progression and access control) and optional user-defined programs are included in the calculations. The calculations are carried out in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CalculateRoadPerformance</code> module of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VETravelPerformance</code> package.</dd>

  <dt>employee commute options program {#employee-commute-options-program}</dt>
  <dd>A voluntary employer-based program aimed at reducing solo commutes by automobile using strategies and incentive tailored towards each specific organization. Strategies range from providing information and management encouragement to use alternative modes of transportation to cash incentives. Cash-out/buy-in programs are one example of the latter.</dd>
  <dd>A massDOT <a href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/guidebook/download">guidebook</a> provides extensive information about such programs.</dd>
  <dd>In some states such programs are mandatory for large employers. Information on Oregon’s <a href="https://www.oregon.gov/deq/aq/programs/pages/eco.aspx">Employee Commute Options</a> program includes information about conducting employee surveys to demonstrate progress towards commuting trip reduction targets.</dd>
  <dt>employment type {#employment-type}</dt>
  <dd>Zonal employment estimates in VisionEval are made for retail, service, and total employment categories. The delineation of retail and service employment is typically by the <a href="https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch?chart=2017">two-digit sectors</a> in the <a href="https://www.census.gov/eos/www/naics/">North American Industrial Classification System</a> (NAICS). The NAICS system is widely used in most governmental reporting systems.</dd>
  <dt>EV surcharge {#ev-surcharge}</dt>
  <dd>Some states impose a tax on electric vehicles beyond sales tax and vehicle registration fees to make up for the shortfall in gasoline sales tax revenue they might otherwise contribute towards the costs of roadway infrastructure. The methods and rates <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/more-states-charge-fees-for-electric-vehicles-11585400401">vary considerably</a>, with some EV owners paying more in sales tax and EV surcharges than most owners of conventional autos. The EV surcharge can be accounted for in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CalculateVehicleOperatingCosts</code> module in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VETravelPerformance</code> package.</dd>
