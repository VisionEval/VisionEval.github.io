# Preface {-}

This is an adaptation of the VisionEval **Concepts Primer** put together by Tara Weidner. It reorganizes the content a bit and attempts to create a version with decent lexicon that doesn't get in the way of reading the text. In this adaptation VisionEval a number of keywords stand out:

+ Certain keywords have specific meaning when describing constructs in VisionEval, and are colored green in the text. For example, you will see [<span style="color:green">age groups</span>][lexicon] often in the text. You can click on any of these links to open a lexicon in a separate window. You can scroll to the specific term you're interested in. This concept primer and the lexicon are meant to be used together (i.e., opened in separate windows).
+ Links to other documents and websites [appear as clickable blue text](https://visioneval.org), like this one that will take you to the VisionEval front page.
+ Specific variable or filenames are shown in `offset text`. For example, you might see a reference to the `FudgeFactor` in the `ModuleName` module. These keywords are generally **not** clickable for variable names, but often are for module names.
