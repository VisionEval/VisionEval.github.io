  <h1 id="vestate">VE-State Model Details</h1>

<h2 id="ve-state-vs-ve-rspm">VE-State Vs. VE-RSPM</h2>

<p>The main difference between VE-RSPM models and VE-State models is that a number of VE-RSPM inputs are specified at the Bzone level. The Bzones are sub-regional geographies, typically census tracts or block groups. Diagrams are available on the VisionEval wiki for a visual explanation of the <a href="https://github.com/VisionEval/VisionEval/wiki/VERSPM-Training/VE-RSPM_Inputs_by_Geo.pdf">VE-RSPM</a> and <a href="https://github.com/VisionEval/VisionEval/wiki/VERSPM-Training/VE-State_Inputs_by_Geo.pdf">VE-State</a> geographies. 
Also, note that ‘Azones’ are typically counties, and ‘Mareas’ are metropolitan areas, typically defined by the boundaries of an MPO.</p>

<p>The following diagrams show how these two model differ at the early stages.
VE-State uses simulation methods to generate land use and housing input in Bzone level.</p>

<h3 id="ve-rspm-structure">VE-RSPM Structure</h3>

<h3 id="ve-state-structure">VE-State Structure</h3>

<p><img align="center" width="600" border="1" src="images/VE-State.png" /></p>

<p>Bzone level attributes are required by a number of modules so methods need to be developed for synthesizing a representative set of Bzones and their characteristics from policies and attributes specified at the Azone and Marea levels. Something like this is done in the GreenSTEP model where a likely distribution of neighborhood population density is synthesized from the overall metropolitan area density. Azone level inputs are provided for base year population and area by development type (metropolitan, town, rural), population growth by development type, and the ratio of urban area growth to population growth. From these inputs, average density is calculated by Azone and development type and a model is applied to synthesize a distribution of neighborhood densities from the average density. 
All of the VE-RSPM modules which assign Bzone characteristics are contained in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VELandUse</code> package. The modules that are developed to synthesize Bzones and their characteristics will be placed in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VESimLandUse</code> package. When a VE-State model is run, the modules in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VESimLandUse</code> package will be run instead of the modules in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VELandUse</code> package. Otherwise the model setup is nearly the same for VE-State and VE-RSPM. The use of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VESimLandUse</code> modules is not be limited to statewide applications however. Users could simulate Bzones in an VE-RSPM-type application that would enable metropolitan area planners to more easily define and model alternative land use scenarios as is done in VE-RPAT (Rapid Policy Analysis Tool) applications.</p>

<h2 id="required-bzone-attributes">Required Bzone Attributes</h2>

<p>Land use modeling in VE-RSPM is the basis for the land use modeling in VE-State. These modules were designed to produce datasets needed to run the new multi-modal travel model. The multi-modal module requires several activity density, diversity (i.e., activity mixing), and destination accessibility measures that in turn require households and employment to be located at the Bzone level to calculate those measures. In addition, a few multi-modal network and service level measures need to be calculated. Second, locating jobs at the Bzone level allows for the travel demand management (TDM) and parking pricing modules to establish more realistic relationships between policies and the households they would affect. This also allows household workers to be assigned to job sites and that information can be used to translate job site TDM and parking policies back to households. Finally, simulated households are assigned to Bzones. In VE-RSPM a number of single family and multifamily dwelling units are assigned to Bzones as inputs along with the relative income distribution of households in each Bzone. VE-RSPM models the housing choice of each household based on the overall supply of housing of each type in the Azone and the household characteristics. Then the model assigns each household to a Bzone based on the household’s housing choice and income, and on the relative supplies of housing of the type and household income distribution in the Bzone. The Bzone attributes that need to be synthesized are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Destination accessibility (i.e., accessibility to jobs and housing) measured consistent as it is used in the multi-modal travel model – This information is one of the 5D measured used in the VE-RSPM multi-modal travel model. Since synthetic zones won’t have physical locations, it can’t be calculated simply from households and employment by zone.</li>
  <li>Number of households proportional split of dwelling units between single family and multifamily – Number of households and dwelling unit split by Bzone is needed in order to assign households to Bzones.</li>
  <li>Number of jobs by sector (retail, service, other) is used in calculating several diversity measures used in the RSPM multi-modal travel model. The number of jobs is also used to associate household workers with workplace Bzones</li>
  <li>Area type and development type – Some practical system of zonal development classification is needed for organizing policy inputs. Policies such as travel demand management policies will be specified by Azone and area type and/or development type. These designations will also be used in the calculation of the design and distance to transit ‘5D’ measure categories that are used in the VE-RSPM multi-modal travel model.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="approach-for-synthesizing-bzones-and-their-attributes">Approach for Synthesizing Bzones and their Attributes</h2>

<ol>
  <li>The user provides inputs on:
    <ul>
      <li>Azone proportional split of dwelling units by location type (metropolitan, town and rural)</li>
      <li>Azone proportional split of workers by job site location types (for example, proportions of rural residents in the Azone who work in rural locations, town locations, or the metropolitan area)</li>
      <li>Marea proportional split of Marea employment among Azones</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Total activity – numbers of households and jobs – will determine the number of SimBzones in the Azone. SimBzones will have equal amounts of activity and unequal areas since activity density will vary among SimBzones. An appropriate average SimBzone activity value will be determined through evaluation of the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/smart-location-mapping#SLD">EPA Smart Location Database (SLD)</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Models will be applied to select a destination accessibility value for each Bzone. For metropolitan type development, the model will create a distribution of destination accessibility values that is consistent with the overall activity density in the metropolitan area. Random sampling from the distribution will be used to assign destination accessibility values to metropolitan SimBzones. Models will also be developed for town and rural types, but more investigation is needed in order to determine their form.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Activity density of each SimBzones will be determined as a function of the destination accessibility of each zone (because destination accessibility is a measure of activity density at a larger geographic scale). A model will be estimated from the SLD which creates a distribution of zone densities as a function of destination accessibility. An adjustment process, such as an iterative proportional fitting process (IPF), will be used to adjust densities and destination accessibilities so that the overall activity density of all the zones in a metropolitan area is equal to the input value</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further subdivision of the metropolitan area into area types will be done as a function of the destination accessibility and activity density of each zone. Four such area types are proposed: urban core, close in community, and suburban/town, low density/rural. The final typology and the relationship of area types to destination accessibility and activity density will be developed through examination of the SLD dataset. It is envisioned that area types will be defined as fuzzy sets rather than crisp sets.  Although some SimBzones may be wholly one type, many SimBzones will have degrees of membership in several types. Using fuzzy sets is a more realistic recognition of the nature of area types and avoids aberrations resulting from threshold effects.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The total activity in each SimBzone is split into households and jobs using a model which relates zonal mixing to destination accessibility, activity density, and area type. This model will be specified and estimated based on investigations using the SLD data. It is anticipated that the model will produce distributions of activity splits from which values will be drawn. IPF or some other adjustment process will be used to adjust values so that the aggregation of the splits for all the SimBzones in an Azone is consistent with the Azone inputs. This model will also need to specify the split of land area between households and jobs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once the number of households is determined for each SimBzone, the split of dwelling units by housing type (single family, multifamily) as a function of activity density. The SLD and census data will be used to develop this model. IPF is be used to fit the distribution of SimBzone values to Azone level control totals. This will allow users to specify Azone ratios as policy inputs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A variant of the VE-RSPM housing model is applied to assign households to housing types and to Bzones. One thing to be worked out is whether the allocation to SimBzones considers household income or not. In VE-RSPM, relative Bzone income distributions are input and these are used in the process of allocating households to Bzones. This enables VE-State users to model general relationships of income to parts of the metropolitan area (e.g., the effect of gentrification in the urban core).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Jobs in each SimBzone will be split into numbers of retail, service, and other jobs. The approach for doing this is yet to be determined. SimBzone splits will be constrained so that they total to Azone splits that are inputs. The model will probably be a function of the destination accessibility, employment density, and mixing of households and employment in the SimBzone. The SLD data will be used to develop and estimate this model. Thought will be given as to whether there should be control totals on the mix for a metropolitan area.  If so, IPF or some other adjustment process would need to be used to match the totals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workers will be assigned to SimBzone job sites. How this is done is yet to be determined. It is proposed that an agile development approach be used where the first iteration of the model will be a random assignment of workers to job sites. Other extensions that could be considered if there is time/budget investigation could be done using LEHD data and SLD data to look for relationships between worker residence by area type and worker job site by area type. Relative income could also be considered.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once numbers of households and numbers of jobs by type are assigned to SimBzones, all the remaining density and diversity measures can be calculated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The distance to transit measure is modeled for metropolitan SimBzones as a function of the metropolitan-level transit supply measure and the SimBzone attributes for destination</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Development type (e.g., residential, employment, mixed, transit-oriented development, greenfield), are assigned to SimBzones based on the density, diversity, and distance to transit measures. These development types, like the area types may be fuzzy sets. The SLD is used to create the development type specifications. The design will enable model users to input Marea goals for the proportional split of development types. The model will adjust the allocation of development types consistent with the goals but constrained to plausible levels.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Network design measures used by the VE-RSPM multi-modal travel model (e.g., multi-modal network density, pedestrian network density) will be applied based on inputs related to area and development type. The SLD will be used to identify ranges of values by area and development type. Users will specify in inputs goals relative to these ranges by Azone, development type and area type.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The parking pricing, travel demand management, and car service inputs is specified by Azone, area type, and development type. These will then be translated to the SimBzone based on the SimBzone area type and development type. After that is done, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AssignDemandManagement</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AssignParkingRestrictions</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AssignCarSvcAvailability</code> modules can run as they currently do. Thought will be given as to how to simplify inputs so that users are not required to provide inputs for every combination of Azone, area type and development type.</li>

<p>Each of these modules use different input data. Generally speaking, the VE-State inputs are classified into the five following categories:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>User input model parameters</strong>: These are input parameters (model or scenario specific), defined in <a href="#model_parametersjson">model_parameters.json</a>, that users should review and modify as needed.</li>
  <li><strong>Fixed input model parameters</strong>: These are input parameters specific to the model, defined in <a href="#model_parametersjson">model_parameters.json</a>, that users should not typically modify.</li>
  <li><strong>User input files</strong>: These are input files (model or scenario specific) that users should review and modify as needed.</li>
  <li><strong>Fixed input files</strong>: These are input parameters specific to the model that are fixed.</li>
  <li><strong>Internal module inputs</strong>: These are inputs created by other VE-RSPM modules.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="vestate-assignlifecycle">AssignLifeCycle</h3>

<p>This module assigns a life cycle category to each household. The life cycle categories are similar, but not the same as, those established for the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS). The age categories used in VisionEval models are broader than those used by the NHTS to identify children of different ages. This is a simple model with set of rules that assigns age group categories based on the age of persons and workers in the household.</p>

<h3 id="vestate-initialize">Initialize</h3>

<p>Modules in the VESimLandUse package synthesize Bzones and their land use attributes as a function of Azone characteristics as well as data derived from the US Environmental Protection Agency’s Smart Location Database (SLD) augmented with US Census housing and household income data, and data from the National Transit Database. Details on these data are included in the VESimLandUseData package. The combined dataset contains a number of land use attributes at the US Census block group level. The goal of Bzone synthesis to generate a set of SimBzones in each Azone that reasonably represent block group land use characteristics given the characteristics of the Azone, the Marea that the Azone is a part of, and scenario inputs provided by the user.</p>

<p>Many of the models and procedures used in Bzone synthesis pivot from profiles developed from these data sources for specific urbanized areas, as well as more general profiles for different urbanized area population size categories, towns, and rural areas. Using these specific and general profiles enables the simulated Bzones (SimBzones) to better represent the areas being modeled and the variety of conditions found in different states. Following is a listing of the urbanized areas for which profiles have been developed. Note that urbanized areas that cross state lines are split into the individual state components. This is done to facilitate the development of state models and to better reflect the characteristics of the urbanized area characteristics in each state.</p>

<p>It is incumbent on the model user to identify the name of the urbanized area profile that will be used for each of the Mareas in the model. This module reads in the names assigned in the “marea_uza_profile_names.csv” file and checks their validity. If any are invalid, input processing will stop and error messages will be written to the log identifying the problem names. The following table identifies the names that may be used.</p>

<h3 id="vestate-createsimbzones">CreateSimBzones</h3>

<p>This module synthesizes Bzones and their land use attributes as a function of Azone characteristics as well as data derived from the US Environmental Protection Agency’s Smart Location Database (SLD) augmented with US Census housing and household income data, and data from the National Transit Database. Details on these data are included in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VESimLandUseData</code> package. The combined dataset contains a number of land use attributes at the US Census block group level. The goal of Bzone synthesis to generate a set of SimBzones in each Azone that reasonably represent block group land use characteristics given the characteristics of the Azone, the Marea that the Azone is a part of, and scenario inputs provided by the user.</p>

<p>Many of the models and procedures used in Bzone synthesis pivot from profiles developed from these data sources for specific urbanized areas, as well as more general profiles for different urbanized area population size categories, towns, and rural areas. Using these specific and general profiles enables the simulated Bzones (SimBzones) to better represent the areas being modeled and the variety of conditions found in different states. The documentation for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Initialize</code> module has a listing of urbanized area profile names.</p>

<p>The models and procedures in this module create SimBzones within each Azone that simulate the land use characteristics of neighborhoods likely to be found in the Azone. The SimBzones are assigned quantities of households and jobs and are attributed with several land use measures in the process. The characteristics are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Location Type</strong>: Identification of whether the SimBzone is located in an urbanized area, a town (i.e. an urban-type area that is not large enough to be urbanized), rural (i.e. dispersed low-density development)</li>
  <li><strong>Households</strong>: Number of households in each SimBzone</li>
  <li><strong>Employment</strong>: Number of jobs in each SimBzone</li>
  <li><strong>Activity Density</strong>: Number of households and jobs per acre</li>
  <li><strong>Land Use Diversity</strong>: Measures of the degree of mixing of households and jobs</li>
  <li><strong>Destination Accessibility</strong>: Measures of proximity to households and jobs</li>
  <li><strong>Area Type and Development Type</strong>: Categories which describe the relative urban nature of the SimBzone (area type) and the character of development in the SimBzone (development type).</li>
  <li><strong>Employment Split</strong>: Number of retail, service, and other jobs in each SimBzone.</li>

<h3 id="vestate-simulatehousing">SimulateHousing</h3>

<p>This module assigns a housing type, either single-family (SF) or multifamily (MF) to regular households based on the respective supplies of SF and MF dwelling units in the housing market to which the household is assigned (i.e. the Azone the household is assigned to) and on household characteristics. It then assigns each household to a SimBzone based on the household’s housing type as well as the supply of housing by type and SimBzone. The module assigns non-institutional group quarters households to SimBzones randomly.</p>

<h3 id="vestate-assignparkingrestrictions">AssignParkingRestrictions</h3>

<p>This module identifies parking restrictions and prices affecting households at their residences, workplaces, and other places they are likely to visit in the urban area. The module takes user inputs on parking restrictions and prices by Bzone and calculates for each household the number of free parking spaces available at the household’s residence, which workers pay for parking and whether their payment is part of a cash-out-buy-back program, the cost of residential parking for household vehicles that can’t be parked in a free space, the cost for workplace parking, and the cost of parking for other activities such as shopping. The parking restriction/cost information is used by other modules in calculating the cost of vehicle ownership and the cost of vehicle use.</p>

### CalculateRoadPerformance {#vestate-calculateroadperformance}     

This module splits light-duty vehicle (LDV) daily vehicle miles of travel DVHT between freeways and arterials as a function of relative speeds and congestion prices. Speeds and prices are combined to calculate an average 'effective' speed for freeways and for arterials. The ratio of freeway and arterial 'effective' speeds and a split factor calculated for the metropolitan area are used to split the LDV DVMT. Iteration is used to find an equilibrium split value. In addition to the LDV freeway DVMT and arterial DVMT, the following performance measures are saved to the datastore:

* Average freeway speed by congestion level;
* Average arterial speed by congestion level;
* Average freeway delay by congestion level;
* Average arterial delay by congestion level;
* Freeway DVMT proportions by congestion level;
* Arterial DVMT proportions by congestion level;
* Average amount paid per mile in congestion pricing fees; and,
* Vehicle hours of delay by vehicle type.

#### User Input Files

1. Operations deployment effects on dvmt for Marea ([marea_operations_deployment.csv](#vestate-marea_operations_deployment.csv))

2. Other operations effects ([other_ops_effectiveness.csv](#vestate-other_ops_effectiveness.csv))

3. Charges by congestion levels by road class ([marea_congestion_charges.csv](#vestate-marea_congestion_charges.csv))

#### User Input Parameters

**Value of time (valueoftime)** : This parameter set the value of time (base cost year dollars per hour).  It should be defined in [model_parameters.json]

   ```json

### BudgetHouseholdDvmt {#vestate-budgethouseholddvmt}      

This module adjusts average household DVMT to keep the quantity within household operating cost limits. The limit for each household is calculated in several steps. First, the proportion of the household's income that may be spent on vehicle operating costs is calculated using a model that is explained below. This is called the budget proportion. Then an adjusted household income
for budget calculation purposes is calculated by adding the annual cost of insurance for households subscribing to payd-as-you-drive (PAYD) insurance, cash-out parking payments for workers who work at an employer that has cash-out-buy-back parking, and any vehicle ownership cost savings for households that substitute high level car service for one or more household
vehicles. The adjusted household income is muliplied by the budget proportion and divided by the average vehicle operating cost per mile for the household to determine the maximum household DVMT that fits within the household budget. The household DVMT is then set at the lesser of this budget maximum or the modeled household DVMT.
The budget proportion model is estimated using data from the Bureau of Labor's consumer expenditure survey for the years from 2003 to 2015. The data used are the nominal dollar expenditures by household income category and year by transportation category. The values for the operating cost categories (gas and oil, and maintenance and repair) are summed and then divided by the
midpoint value for each income category to calculate the budget proportion for each income group and each year. From this the mean value is computed for each income group. The budget proportions for each income group and year are divided by the mean values by income group to normalize values. The standard deviation for the combined normalized values is computed and value of 3
deviations above the mean is set as the maximum normalized value. The mean values by income group are multiplied by this normalized maximum to derive a budget proportion maximum by income group. A smoothed splines model of the budget proportion as a function of income is then estimated from the calculated budget proportion maximums. This model is used to calculate the budget proportion for a household based on the household income. The minimum and
maximum values of the calculated budget proportion maximums are used as constraints to avoid unreasonable results for very low incomes and very high incomes.

##  Development and Installation

This section describes the installation and use of VE-State.

## Installation of VisionEval and VE-State

VE-State and VisionEval framework are implemented in R, a statistical programming language and environment.  Both R and VisionEval are open source and freely available. For running VE-State you need to follow these steps:

1. [Install R](https://cran.r-project.org/) (users are encouraged to also install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), a free and open-source integrated development environment for R)
2. [Install VisionEval](https://visioneval.org/category/download.html)
3. Run VE-State

The VisionEval installer is available [here](https://visioneval.org/category/download.html). Follow the instructions on this page carefully to install the VisionEval on your system.


## In Brief: Running VE-State Base Scenario

See the VisionEval [Getting Started documentation](https://github.com/VisionEval/VisionEval/wiki/Getting-Started-v2) for an overview of the framework methods for running models and querying results.

1. Double-click `VisionEval.Rproj` in the location where you installed VisionEval. This will launch RStudio.
2. Enter `statemod &lt;- openModel('VE-State')`
3. Enter `statemod$run()`

<img align="center" width="600" border="1" src="images/run_VE-State.PNG" />

## In Detail: Running VE-State Base Scenario


### Preparing inputs
Once VisionEval and VE-State have been installed, a directory with sample data will be available at `../models/VE-State/`. (Note `..` refers to the parent directory of the unzipped installer file). 

The `VE-State` directory serves the dual purposes of providing sample data and serving as a template for local modification to other locations. 

The `../models/VE-State/` directory contains sample input files for Oregon. These inputs can be modified or replaced to investigate the impacts of policy changes or to model a different state.  The folder contains multiple files and subfolders:

<img align="center" width="500" border="1" src="images/vestate.PNG" />

`run_model.R` is the core script for running the model. It consists of calls to the modules that make up the model. The user may modify the script to call the  desired modules.

<img align="center" width="800" border="1" src="images/run_model.PNG" />

The `defs` directory contains five model definition files which is introduced in [Model Definition Files](Inputs_and_Parameters.md)

The `inputs` directory contains a number of `CSV` and `JSON` files that provide inputs for the modules. Each module specifies what input files it needs. If you would like to know 
the description of each input file and how you can change those files for your desired testing see [Inputs_and_Parameters](Inputs_and_Parameters.md/#input-files)


<img align="center" width="700" border="1" src="images/inputs.PNG" />

The `../models/VE-State` directory contains sample input files for state of Oregon.  These can be modified or replaced to investigate the impacts of policy changes or to model a different state.  


### Running the Model

There are multiple ways to run VisionEval models. VisionEval models can be run via the command line directly or using `openModel`, and can be run for one scenario or multiple scenarios in parallel. Results can be viewed in tabular form or with the interactive `VEScenarioViewer`.

1. Start R (or RStudio) and make sure your directory is set to the installer folder. The easiest way to do this is to double-click `VisionEval.Rproj`, which will be associated with RStudio if that is installed correctly.
2. You should see 'Welcome to VisionEval!' on the RStudio console. Then run the following commands:

```
statemod &lt;- openModel('VE-State')
statemod$run()
```

By default this will run the model in `../models/VE-State/` directory. The default model is for Oregon, for 2010 and 2040. 

After running the script you will see how the modules will be running in order.

The model run will take approximately 45 minutes. Once complete, the output are exported to `../models/VE-State/outputs` in 3 different zone levels.

## Querying results

To extract all results to .csv files, run:

```
statemod$extract()
```

On the R console, you will see messages about what tables are being extracted and where the files are being saved, e.g.:

For a state-wide model, the `Household` and `Vehicle` tables in particular can be quite large, and this full result extraction might take several minutes. 

To extract just one field, for example DVMT at the household level for 2010 and 2040, first select just the Household table using the `tablesSelected` method:

```
statemod$tablesSelected &lt;- 'Household'
```

Then select the `Dvmt` field:

```
statemod$fieldsSelected &lt;- 'Dvmt'
```

Extract the result to a list of data frames for plotting, rather than to a .csv file. Some manipulation of the list can be done to put the fields in one data frame for plotting, for example:

```
hh_dvmt &lt;- statemod$extract(saveTo = F)
hh_dvmt &lt;- unlist(hh_dvmt)
year &lt;- names(hh_dvmt)
year &lt;- ifelse(grepl('2010', year), '2010', '2040')
hh_dvmt &lt;- data.frame(year, Dvmt = hh_dvmt)
```

Plot using the `ggplot2` library, for example:

```
ggplot(hh_dvmt, aes(x = Dvmt, fill = year)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  ylab('Number of Households') +
  ggtitle('Distribution of DVMT by VE-State for Oregon')
```

Other query methods are described in the [Getting Started documentation](https://github.com/VisionEval/VisionEval/wiki/Getting-Started-v2## extracting-model-results). 

### Scenarios

To modify a scenario, the appropriate input files are edited.  For example, to change the flat rate tax of vehicles for future [`azone_hh_veh_own_taxes.csv`](https://github.com/visioneval/VisionEval/blob/master/sources/modules/VEHouseholdVehicles/inst/module_docs/CalculateVehicleOwnCost.md## azone_hh_veh_own_taxescsv) would be modified in Excel, LibreOffice, OpenOffice, or a text editor to change the `VehOwnFlatRateFee` of year 2038.

##  Development and Installation

This section describes the installation and use of VE-State.

## Installation of VisionEval and VE-State

VE-State and VisionEval framework are implemented in R, a statistical programming language and environment.  Both R and VisionEval are open source and freely available. For running VE-State you need to follow these steps:

1. [Install R](https://cran.r-project.org/) (users are encouraged to also install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), a free and open-source integrated development environment for R)
2. [Install VisionEval](https://visioneval.org/category/download.html)
3. Run VE-State

The VisionEval installer is available [here](https://visioneval.org/category/download.html). Follow the instructions on this page carefully to install the VisionEval on your system.


## In Brief: Running VE-State Base Scenario

See the VisionEval [Getting Started documentation](https://github.com/VisionEval/VisionEval/wiki/Getting-Started-v2) for an overview of the framework methods for running models and querying results.

1. Double-click `VisionEval.Rproj` in the location where you installed VisionEval. This will launch RStudio.
2. Enter `statemod &lt;- openModel('VE-State')`
3. Enter `statemod$run()`

## In Detail: Running VE-State Base Scenario


### Preparing inputs
Once VisionEval and VE-State have been installed, a directory with sample data will be available at `../models/VE-State/`. (Note `..` refers to the parent directory of the unzipped installer file). 

The `VE-State` directory serves the dual purposes of providing sample data and serving as a template for local modification to other locations. 

The `../models/VE-State/` directory contains sample input files for Oregon. These inputs can be modified or replaced to investigate the impacts of policy changes or to model a different state.  The folder contains multiple files and subfolders:

<img align="center" width="500" border="1" src="images/vestate.PNG" />

`run_model.R` is the core script for running the model. It consists of calls to the modules that make up the model. The user may modify the script to call the  desired modules.

<img align="center" width="800" border="1" src="images/run_model.PNG" />

The `defs` directory contains five model definition files which is introduced in [Model Definition Files](Inputs_and_Parameters.md)

The `inputs` directory contains a number of `CSV` and `JSON` files that provide inputs for the modules. Each module specifies what input files it needs. If you would like to know 
the description of each input file and how you can change those files for your desired testing see [Inputs_and_Parameters](Inputs_and_Parameters.md/#input-files)


<img align="center" width="700" border="1" src="images/inputs.PNG" />

The `../models/VE-State` directory contains sample input files for state of Oregon.  These can be modified or replaced to investigate the impacts of policy changes or to model a different state.  


### Running the Model

There are multiple ways to run VisionEval models. VisionEval models can be run via the command line directly or using `openModel`, and can be run for one scenario or multiple scenarios in parallel. Results can be viewed in tabular form or with the interactive `VEScenarioViewer`.

1. Start R (or RStudio) and make sure your directory is set to the installer folder. The easiest way to do this is to double-click `VisionEval.Rproj`, which will be associated with RStudio if that is installed correctly.
2. You should see 'Welcome to VisionEval!' on the RStudio console. Then run the following commands:

```
statemod &lt;- openModel('VE-State')
statemod$run()
```

By default this will run the model in `../models/VE-State/` directory. The default model is for Oregon, for 2010 and 2040. 

After running the script you will see how the modules will be running in order.

The model run will take approximately 45 minutes. Once complete, the output are exported to `../models/VE-State/outputs` in 3 different zone levels.

## Querying results

To extract all results to .csv files, run:

```
statemod$extract()
```

On the R console, you will see messages about what tables are being extracted and where the files are being saved, e.g.:

```
Extracting data for Table Azone in Group 2010
Extracting data for Table Bzone in Group 2010
Extracting data for Table Household in Group 2010
[...]
Write output file: /models/VE-State/output/Azone_2010_1_2021-03-02_153010.csv
Write output file: /models/VE-State/output/Bzone_2010_1_2021-03-02_153010.csv
[...]
```

For a state-wide model, the `Household` and `Vehicle` tables in particular can be quite large, and this full result extraction might take several minutes. 

To extract just one field, for example DVMT at the household level for 2010 and 2040, first select just the Household table using the `tablesSelected` method:

```
statemod$tablesSelected &lt;- 'Household'
```

Then select the `Dvmt` field:

```
statemod$fieldsSelected &lt;- 'Dvmt'
```

Extract the result to a list of data frames for plotting, rather than to a .csv file. Some manipulation of the list can be done to put the fields in one data frame for plotting, for example:

```
hh_dvmt &lt;- statemod$extract(saveTo = F)
hh_dvmt &lt;- unlist(hh_dvmt)
year &lt;- names(hh_dvmt)
year &lt;- ifelse(grepl('2010', year), '2010', '2040')
hh_dvmt &lt;- data.frame(year, Dvmt = hh_dvmt)
```

Plot using the `ggplot2` library, for example:

```
ggplot(hh_dvmt, aes(x = Dvmt, fill = year)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  ylab('Number of Households') +
  ggtitle('Distribution of DVMT by VE-State for Oregon')
```
