      "excerpt"		: "Hydeout updates the original Hydetheme for Jekyll 3.x and adds new functionality.Keep It SimpleIn keeping with the original Hyde theme, Hydeout aims to keep the overalldesign lightweight and plugin-free. JavaScript is currently limited onlyto Disqus and Google Analytics (and is only loaded if you provide configurationvariables).Hydeout makes heavy use of Flexbox in its CSS. If Flexbox is not available,the CSS degrades into a single column layout.CustomizationHydeout replaces Hyde’s class-based theming with the useof the following SASS variables:$sidebar-bg-color: #202020 !default;$sidebar-sticky: true !default;$layout-reverse: false !default;$link-color: #268bd2 !default;To override these variables, create your own assets/css/main.scss file.Define your own variables, then import in Hydeout’s SCSS, like so:---# Jekyll needs front matter for SCSS files---$sidebar-bg-color: #ac4142;$link-color: #ac4142;$sidebar-sticky: false;@import &quot;hydeout&quot;;See the _variables file for other variablesyou can override.You can also insert custom head tags (e.g. to load your own stylesheets) bydefining your own _includes/custom-head.html or insert tags at the endof the body (e.g. for custom JS) by defining your own_includes/custom-foot.html.New Features      Hydeout also adds a new tags page (accessible in the sidebar) and a new“category” layout for dedicated category pages.        Category pages are automatically added to the sidebar. All other pagesmust have sidebar_link: true in their front matter to show up inthe sidebar.        A simple redirect-to-Google search is available. If you want to useGoogle Custom Search or Algolia or something with more involved,override the search.html.        Disqus integration is ready out of the box. Just add the following toyour config file:    disqus:  shortname: my-disqus-shortname        If you don’t want Disqus or want to use something else, overridecomments.html.        For Google Analytics support, define a google_analytics variable withyour property ID in your config file.  There’s also a bunch of minor tweaks and adjustments throughout thetheme. Hope this works for you!"

You always know after you are two. Two is the beginning of the end.Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her children’s minds. It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day."
