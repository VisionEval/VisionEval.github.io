Using **strategic tools** for long range **performance-based** planning (23 U.S. Code ยง 134, 135) is a valued analytical approach to complement traditional travel modeling methods that helps state and metropolitan area governments select policies and actions to address pressing  long-range goals, especially those fraught with uncertainty. 

VisionEval (https://visioneval.org) is a collaborative project that built a family of strategic tools for performance-based transportation planning into a single open-source programming framework. A supporting community of partner agencies and others share in its use and enhancement.  In 2021, VisionEval received the
<a href="https://zephyrtransport.org/technical-achievement-award/" target = "_blank">Zephyr Foundation Exceptional Technical Achievement Award</a>.

Users support the continuing development of VisionEval via a Pooled Fund, drawing from successful past and interested future users. 

### A new Pooled Fund study will be opening soon! Contact the user group at info@visioneval.org
