## Website management

This website is built with the '[So Simple](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme)' theme for GitHub pages. It uses Jekyll, a tool built in Ruby to generate web pages from content written in Markdown, and is integrated with GitHub.

To make updates to this website, the following steps are required:
 - Download and install [Ruby](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/)
 - Open a Unix or Unix-like command-line utility (Terminal on Mac, (Git BASH)[http://gitforwindows.org/] on Windows will work)
 - Install Jekyll with `gem install jekyll`. See details [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation)
 - Install bundler with `gem install bundler`. This Ruby tool updates all needed Ruby dependencies.
 - Clone this repository to your machine, navigate to it, and `bundle install`.
 - Now you can make edits to the contents. After doing so, you can preview the changes before pushing to the repository with:
	+ `bundle exec jekyll build`
	+ `bundle exec jekyll serve`
	+ These are essentially the same steps that GitHub takes when generating a `gh-pages` page from a repository, and let you see the rendered site as you make changes on the fly.
