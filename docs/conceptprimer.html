<p>VisionEval differs from traditional travel demand models both in how it works and what kind of planning concerns it helps to address. This chapter provides a quick introduction approach to the unique features and applications of VisionEval. It reviews the main model components and key concepts at a high level, to assist new users in understanding concepts they will apply as they set up scenarios, develop inputs and evaluate outputs. Links to more detailed documentation will allow the reader to delve further into each topic, as they choose.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> What can I do with VisionEval?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-can-i-do-with-visioneval"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Structurally, VisionEval may be described as a “disaggregate demand/aggregate supply” model. That is, it combines rich demographic and socioeconomic detail from a synthetic population with aggregate treatments of travel (multi-modal VMT and congestion without explicit trips, or transport networks). The implication of the “aggregate supply” model is that VisionEval cannot be used to evaluate performance of specific projects or corridors.</p>
<p>What VisionEval can do, and even makes especially simple, is to evaluate large numbers of scenarios and explore how combinations of alternative future conditions might affect performance measures. Travel demand models, whether built using traditional trip-based or more contemporary activity-based techniques, sacrifice flexibility for network detail. It is difficult in such models to capture novel behaviors such as an increased propensity to use inexpensive ride-hailing services, or to express shifts in vehicle ownership and occupancy that may be influenced by multiple factors some of which have not yet been observed. Yet these potential shifts are often very important for assessing the potential of pricing, investment strategies or other policy priorities. VisionEval also makes it relatively simple to explore risks and opportunities that may eventually be realized as new transportation options mature.</p>
<p>VisionEval won’t help us determine if a particular highway segment should be built or upgraded, or what kind of transit service improvements should be extended into new areas. But it can help us look at the market for new technologies, and explore future scenarios that are based both on changed circumstances (altered demographics, increased congestion, or alternate road pricing strategies) as well as on changed behaviors (including behaviors that <em>might</em> happen, but that we have not yet observed because the key enabling technologies are too early in their deployment). VisionEval results can be explored in detail by market segment, asking questions about how benefits might be distributed regionally, and what overall system performance might look like.</p>
<p>Ultimately, VisionEval is a system for asking a very broad range of “what if” questions about how the transportation system might perform, and how its benefits and costs might be distributed over the community. It can efficiently process hundreds of scenarios looking at many different types of interventions, alternative policies, and hypothetical future conditions and travel behaviors. The results can inform strategic questions, helping decision makers answer questions such as “What are our options for achieving this performance result?” or “What are our risks if new transportation technologies develop in these different ways?”</p>
<p>Using VisionEval to answer such questions does not make other types of modeling obsolete (such as travel demand models or corridor microsimulations). Instead, it helps to determine what is worth the effort to code into these more detailed models, and also to explore and document novel assumptions about the future that may require extra effort to implement, and that would be prohibitively expensive to explore through traditional planning models.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Strengths and limitations<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#strengths-and-limitations"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>VisionEval operates at broad geographic levels and without explicit network representations to enable very fast analyses across scores of different assumptions and inputs. It is especially well suited for quickly evaluating several different combinations of policies or assessing the range of impacts when uncertainty exists in several key inputs. Because much of the travel behavior is asserted based on observed travel patterns the latter can be changed to reflect expected changes due to new technologies, services, and expected changes in behavior over time. Thus, VisionEval is better suited than traditional travel modeling approaches for certain pursuits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Screening a wide range of policy actions, especially in the face of uncertainties where ranges of expected responses or effects must be considered</li>
<li>Resilience testing under uncertainties (e.g., population growth, household size, fuel prices)</li>
<li>Directly “comparing and contrasting” broad ranges or combinations of policies (e.g., ITS, transit service, active transport, demand management)</li>
<li>Analysis of broad policy or technology changes (e.g., carbon taxes, low-carbon fuels)</li>
<li>Evaluating fuel consumption, particulate emissions, and greenhouse gas emissions impacts of proposed policies</li>
</ul>
<p>However, VisionEval is not well suited for detailed geographic analyses, to include the effects of congestion on individual trips or tours. Thus, examining the effects of localized land use (e.g. parcel or block) or network assumptions cannot be carried out using VisionEval. Improvements in network capacity, efficiency, or safety can only be indirectly incorporated in VisionEval.</p>

<p>Traditional travel forecasting models divide a study area into thousands of traffic analysis zones in order to facilitate highly granular spatial analyses.

</h3>
<p>VisionEval is a strategic modeling system. It differs from traditional travel demand and microsimulation models principally in that it is applied earlier in the planning process, and it is used for different purposes. Rather than examining the detailed performance of specific facilities (assessing individual projects), VisionEval estimates regional and small area performance metrics that reflect overarching policy goals such as emission reduction, regional VMT, or mode share.</p>
<p>Traditional travel models used for planning purposes are applied to estimate outcomes under a small number of alternate input scenarios that vary land use characteristics (e.g. type and density of land uses), socioeconomic characteristics (e.g. population, ages, incomes), and/or transportation characteristics (e.g. road alignments, lane configurations, tolls, etc.). In these models, the response to the changed inputs is estimated based on parameters typically derived from household surveys and other related data sources: that is, the behavior in the model is presumed to be what we see today. Even though such models are often behaviorally complex (e.g., activity-based models), the effort required to assess many alternative scenarios is often prohibitive, and because such models are built using complex estimation procedures rooted in detailed data about existing behavior, it can be technically difficult or impossible to reliably encode possible future shifts in behavior, or to explore alternative possible future behaviors.</p>
<p>VisionEval is typically set up to run many scenarios that explore a broad set of alternative policies and investment priorities that may result from a variety of possible categories of policy and project interventions, or from a range of possible future conditions (strong or weak economic growth, demographics that shift at different rates), or from uncertain deployment of new technologies such as app-based ridesharing (Transportation Network Companies or TNCs).</p>
<p>A full application of VisionEval may examine hundreds or even thousands of permutations of inputs representing many possible future outcomes. The outputs allow planners and decision-makers to explore the outcomes of each scenario compared to the others, so they can visualize and discuss the relative impact and cross-influences, as well as the unintended consequences, of factors represented across the scenarios. VisionEval allows planners to assess alternative assumptions about uncertain phenomena such as autonomous vehicle (AV) deployment, it is a very effective tool for identifying risks and opportunities, as well as for formulating effective strategic responses to new challenges for which little current data exists or for which many outcomes are possible yet none are certain. The most interesting of the resulting strategic plans can be refined with more detailed models. Based on the strategic modeling findings, uncertainties can be confidently simplified into a smaller number of scenarios to explore in detail.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding its typical application as a strategic model, VisionEval does allow detailed investigation of certain phenomena such as fleet composition and vehicle ownership in relation to Greenhouse Gas Analysis. It also is unique in its ability to explore budget constraints on travel. Its simulation of individual households enables it to assess policies that would be difficult or impossible to model successfully with traditional models.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> Scenario analyses<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#scenario-analyses"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>A key value of VisionEval is how it facilitates running many scenarios or possible futures. In practice, the user typically starts by setting up the model with a reference scenario (i.e. a scenario that represents current policies and extrapolation of current trends). The model can be validated for current and past years at this point. This Reference scenario then serves as a pivot point for the development of alternative scenarios that modify one or more policy assumptions or other assumptions about the future (e.g. assumptions about urban area expansion, assumptions about future light-duty vehicle fleet composition). Because VisionEval models address a large number of factors that are specified by dozens of input files, and because each set of inputs could have many different values, the potential number of alternate scenarios that could be defined is probably uncountable. For this reason, the scenario generation process is simplified by defining <em>categories</em> of inputs that are related in how they affect behavior or are related in how policies are likely to be deployed. An example of the former would be the definition of a pricing category that groups all inputs affecting the price/cost of operating light-duty vehicles (e.g. fuel price, congestion price, carbon price). An example of the latter would be the definition of a land use category which in addition to including land use inputs such as development density, also includes transportation inputs that are associated with land use such as transit service frequency. For each category of inputs, several <em>levels</em> of change from the reference scenario assumptions are defined. Alternate scenarios can then be developed by swapping out reference scenario inputs in each category with different level inputs for the category. This is typically done in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sensitivity tests that change a single category of inputs for each run. Such tests are useful for exploring the relative effects of each category.</li>
<li>Combinatorial tests which compose scenarios from combinations of all categories and all levels.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the number of combinatorial scenarios is a function of the number of categories and the number of levels in each category. For example, if inputs are grouped into 5 categories and each category has 3 levels, at total of 243 scenarios (3x3x3x3x3) would be generated by all combinations. For this reason, automated processes are typically developed to aid in the set-up and running of these scenarios, and analysis of the results.</p>

<p>One of the strengths of VisionEval is the rich detail on individual households. This allows for household specific policies, travel behavior can respond to specific household costs and attributes, and outputs can be mined for differences by population groups. The approach of building on a synthesized population borrows from the state of the practice in activity-based travel demand models.</p>

<p>VisionEval creates simulated households in each Azone from user-supplied projections of persons by <a href="conceptprimer.html#age-group"><span style="color:green">age group</span></a> and average per capita income. Each simulated household has the characteristics of the number of persons in each of 6 age groups, number of workers in each of 5 age groups, <a href="conceptprimer.html#lifecycle"><span style="color:green">lifecycle category</span></a>, and household income. The simulated households are assigned a <a href="conceptprimer.html#dwelling-unit-type"><span style="color:green">dwelling unit type</span></a> (single family or multi-family) using a model that is sensitive to the household characteristics and the number of units of each type assigned to the Azone (based on user inputs). Each simulated household is assigned to a Bzone based on the number of dwelling units of their assigned type in each Bzone and the household’s income compared to the relative income distribution by BZone. Separately, Bzones are attributed with employment and land use attributes (<a href="conceptprimer.html#location-type"><span style="color:green">location type</span></a>, <a href="conceptprimer.html#buit-form-measures"><span style="color:green">built form ‘D’ values</span></a>, <a href="conceptprimer.html#urban-mixed-use"><span style="color:green">urban mixed use</span></a>, and <a href="conceptprimer.html#employment-type"><span style="color:green">employment by type</span></a>). Household members who are workers are assigned a Bzone work location as a function of the distribution of jobs in the model area. Each home and work location is tied to a specific Bzone with its associated attributes.</p>
<p>Policies are added to each household as a function of their home and work Bzones:</p>

</h4>
<p>Household synthesis is carried out in several steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<em>Create customized PUMS dataset</em>: This is done prior to setting up a model in VisionEval. A household dataset is prepared from <a href="conceptprimer.html#census-pums"><span style="color:green">Census PUMS</span></a> data for the modeled region. The default data included with VisionEval is for Oregon. PUMS data for other regions may be used instead, rebuilding the package to reflect Census households for the region of interest.</li>
<li>
<em>Create Households</em>: The identified types of PUMS households are expanded to meet user control totals and other demographic inputs. <a href="conceptprimer.html#census-pums"><span style="color:green">Census PUMS</span></a> data are used define probabilities that a person by <a href="conceptprimer.html#age-group"><span style="color:green">age group</span></a> would be found in each of hundreds of household types. A matrix balancing process is used to allocate persons by age to each of the PUMS household types in a way that matches input control totals and optional constraints. The sampled households are expanded to meet user control totals and other demographic inputs.</li>
<li>
<em>Predict Workers</em>: The number of workers by <a href="conceptprimer.html#age-group"><span style="color:green">age group</span></a> within each simulated household is predicted using <a href="conceptprimer.html#census-pums"><span style="color:green">Census PUMS</span></a> probabilities. The user may optionally specify changes in employment rates by age group and Azone to simulate changes in labor force participation over time and/or differences in employment rates by location.</li>
<li>
<em>Assign LifeCyle</em>: Categorizes households are categorized by six <a href="conceptprimer.html#lifecycle"><span style="color:green">lifecycle</span></a> categories given the household age mix and employment status.</li>
<li>
<em>Predict Income</em>: The annual income for each simulated household is predicted as a function of the household’s worker count by age group, the average per capita income where the household resides (AZone), and interactions between neighborhood income and age (all and seniors). The models are estimated with <a href="conceptprimer.html#census-pums"><span style="color:green">Census PUMS</span></a> data.</li>

<p>The number of drivers and autos in each household are calculated in two steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<em>Assign Drivers</em>: Drivers by <a href="conceptprimer.html#age-group"><span style="color:green">age group</span></a> are assigned to each household as a function of the numbers of persons and workers by age group, the household income, land use characteristics, and transit availability. <a href="conceptprimer.html#metropolitan-area"><span style="color:green">Metropolitan areas</span></a> are also sensitive to transit service level and urban <a href="conceptprimer.html#mixed-use"><span style="color:green">mixed use</span></a> indicators at the home location.

<li>
<em>Assign Vehicle Ownership</em>: The number of vehicles owned or leased by each household are determined as a function of household characteristics, land use characteristics, and transportation system characteristics. Households in <a href="conceptprimer.html#metropolitan-area"><span style="color:green">metropolitan areas</span></a> are also sensitive to <a href="conceptprimer.html#transit-service-levels"><span style="color:green">transit service level</span></a> and <a href="conceptprimer.html#urban-mixed-use"><span style="color:green">urban mixed use</span></a> indicators at the home location.

<p>Two steps are required to add land use attributes to the synthetic population:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<em>Calculate 4D Measures</em>: Several land use <a href="conceptprimer.html#buit-form-measures"><span style="color:green">5D built form measures</span></a> are calculated for each Bzone. The <code>density</code>, <code>diversity</code>, and <code>destination</code> accessibilities are based on Bzone population, employment, dwelling units, and <code>developable land area</code> inputs. The <code>design</code> variable is a user input.</li>
<li>
<em>Calculate Urban Mixed Use Measure</em>: An <a href="conceptprimer.html#urban-mixed-use"><span style="color:green">urban mixed</span></a> measure for the household is calculated based on population density of the home Bzone and <a href="conceptprimer.html#dwelling-unit-type"><span style="color:green">dwelling unit type</span></a>. The model is based on 2001 NHTS data. The model iterates to match an optional input target on the share of households to locate in <a href="conceptprimer.html#urban-mixed-use"><span style="color:green">urban mixed-use</span></a> areas.</li>

<p>Several land use attributes are added to each household:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<em>Assign Location Types</em>: Households are assigned to land use <a href="conceptprimer.html#location-type"><span style="color:green">location types</span></a> – urban, town, or rural – by random allocation based on the household’s <a href="conceptprimer.html#dwelling-unit-type"><span style="color:green">dwelling unit type</span></a> and input proportions on the mix of dwelling types in its enclosing Bzone.</li>

A worker table is developed and each worker is assigned to a work Bzone. The assignment essentially uses a gravity-type model with tabulations of workers and jobs by Bzone (marginal controls) and distance between residence and employment Bzones (IPF seed, inverse of straight-line distances between home and all work Bzone centroids).</li>

<p>Several assumptions about parking, demand management, and mobility services can also be coded:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/VisionEval/VisionEval/blob/master/api/VE_Training_March_13-14_2019/VE_Training.md#46-assignparkingrestrictions-module"><em>Assign Parking Restrictions</em></a>: Households are assigned specific <a href="conceptprimer.html#parking-restrictions"><span style="color:green">parking restrictions</span></a> and fees for their residence, workplace(s), and other places they are likely to visit based on parking inputs by BZone (within Bzones coded as within metropolitan areas [Marea] only).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Residential Parking Restrictions &amp; Fees</em>: The number of free parking spaces available at the household’s residence is set based on input value that identify the average residential parking spaces by dwelling type in each Bzone. For household vehicles that cannot be parked in a free space a residential parking cost (part of auto ownership costs) is identified as a function of input parking rates for the home Bzone (if any).</li>
<li>
<em>Employer Parking and Fees</em>: Which workers pay for parking is set by inputs that define the proportion of workers facing parking fees in each Bzone. Whether their payment is part of a <a href="conceptprimer.html#cash-out-buy-back"><span style="color:green">cash out/buy back</span></a> program is similarly set by input proportions by Bzone and associated fees set by input parking rates for the work Bzone.</li>
<li>
<em>Non-work Parking Fees:</em> The cost of parking for other activities such as shopping is estimated as the likelihood that a household would visit each Bzone and the parking fee in that Bzone. The likelihood is calculated with a gravity-type model, given the relative amount of activity in the Bzone (numbers of households by Bzone and the scaled retail and service job attractions by Bzone as marginals) and the proximity to each destination (inverse distance matrix from home Bzone seed matrix). The average daily parking cost is a weighted average of the fee faced in each destination bzone and the likelihood of visiting that Bzone.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Watch a <a href="https://youtu.be/-ylFbyLfhbw?t=5927">video overview</a> of the Household Multimodal Travel module</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Travel of various modes by households (vehicle, transit, bike, and walk modes) is estimated as a simple function of the rich demographic and land use attributes of the household. In <a href="conceptprimer.html#metropolitan-area"><span style="color:green">metropolitan areas</span></a> travel is also influenced by inputs on transport supply on a per capita basis, such as available roadway capacity and <a href="conceptprimer.html#bus-equivalent-miles"><span style="color:green">bus-equivalent transit service</span></a> levels. Transit, bike, and walk trips are also influenced by household VMT (i.e. if household VMT decreases, trips by these modes increase, and vise verse). Traditional travel models incorporate behavioral dynamics in choice models to build tours and trips for each synthetic person. VisionEval, by contrast, uses simple regression equations that directly estimate average per capita trips and miles by mode, linked by average trip lengths.</p>
<p>After adjusting VMT for household budget limitations it is further adjusted for household participation in TDM programs (home &amp; work-based) and <a href="conceptprimer.html#sov-diversion"><span style="color:green">short-trip SOV diversion</span></a> before calculating household trips for all modes. The household’s bike miles are also adjusted to reflect SOV diversion input.</p>
<p>The following sections describe each module, which are implemented in sequence:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The household’s daily VMT is calculated without household budget adjustments</li>
<li>The household’s vehicle operating costs are calculated</li>
<li>The household’s vehicle operating cost budget is calculated and daily VMT is adjusted to fit within the budget if necessary</li>
<li>Daily VMT reductions due to TDM measures and short-trip SOV diversions are calculated and applied</li>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<em>Assign Transit Service</em>: Transit service levels are input for each <a href="conceptprimer.html#metropolitan-area"><span style="color:green">metropolitan areas</span></a> and neighborhood (Bzone). Annual revenue-miles (i.e. transit miles in revenue service) by eight <a href="conceptprimer.html#transit-modes"><span style="color:green">transit modes</span></a> are read from inputs for each metropolitan area.

<p>Household travel by vehicles are calculated in three steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<em>Calculate Household Daily VMT (Dvmt)</em>: Household average daily vehicle miles traveled (VMT) is estimated as a function of household characteristics(income, workers, children, drivers), vehicle ownership, and attributes of the neighborhood (population density) and metropolitan area (<a href="conceptprimer.html#urban-mixed-use"><span style="color:green">urban mixed-use</span></a>, <a href="conceptprimer.html#transit-service-levels"><span style="color:green">transit service level</span></a>, freeway lane-miles) where the household resides. It also calculates household VMT percentiles which are used by other modules to calculate whether a household is likely to own an electric vehicle (EV) and to calculate the proportions of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) VMT powered by electricity. These values are derived from the 2001 <a href="conceptprimer.html#nhts"><span style="color:green">NHTS</span></a> data.</li>
<li>
<em>CalculateVehicleTrips</em>: This module calculates average daily vehicle trips for households consistent with the household VMT. Average length of household vehicle trips is estimated as a function of household characteristics (drivers/non-driers, income), vehicle ownership (<a href="conceptprimer.html#auto-sufficiency"><span style="color:green">auto sufficiency</span></a>), and attributes of the neighborhood (population density) and <a href="conceptprimer.html#metropolitan-area"><span style="color:green">metropolitan area</span></a> (<a href="conceptprimer.html#urban-mixed-use"><span style="color:green">urban mixed-use</span></a>, freeway lane-miles) where the household resides, and interactions among these variables. The average trip length is divided into the average household VMT to get an estimate of average number of daily vehicle trips.</li>
<li>
<em>Calculate AltMode Trips</em>: This module calculates household transit trips, walk trips, and bike trips. The models are sensitive to household VMT so they are run after all household VMT adjustments (e.g., to account for cost on household VMT) are made. Twelve models estimate trips for the three modes in metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas, in two steps each. The first step determines whether a household has any AltMode trips and the second part determines the number of trips. All of the models include terms for household characteristics (size, income, age mix) and the household’s overall VMT. Neighborhood factors (population density) factors into all but the bike trip models. For households in metropolitan areas <a href="conceptprimer.html#transit-service-levels"><span style="color:green">transit service level</span></a> has an impact as well, with transit ridership also sensitive to when residents live in <a href="conceptprimer.html#urban-mixed-use"><span style="color:green">urban mixed-use</span></a> neighborhoods.</li>

</h4>
<p>Household single-occupant vehicle (SOV) travel is reduced to achieve bike and micro-transportation input policy goals, i.e., for diverting a portion of SOV travel within a 20-mile tour distance (round trip distance). This allows evaluating the potential for light-weight vehicles (e.g. bicycles, electric bikes, electric scooters) and infrastructure to support their use, in reducing SOV travel. First, the amount of the household’s VMT that occurs in SOV tours having round trip distances of 20 miles or less is estimated. Then the average trip length within those tours is estimated. Both models are sensitive to household characteristics(drivers, income, kids), vehicle ownership (<a href="conceptprimer.html#auto-sufficiency"><span style="color:green">auto sufficiency</span></a>), and attributes of the neighborhood (population density, dwelling type) and <a href="conceptprimer.html#metropolitan-area"><span style="color:green">metropolitan area</span></a> (<a href="conceptprimer.html#urban-mixed-use"><span style="color:green">urban mixed-use</span></a>, freeway lane-miles) where the household resides, and the household’s overall VMT.</p>
<p>The diversion of these short trips is assumed to only apply in urban and town <a href="conceptprimer.html#location-type"><span style="color:green">location types</span></a>. The VMT reductions are allocated to households as a function of the household’s SOV VMT and (the inverse of) SOV trip length. In other words, it is assumed that households having more qualifying SOV travel and households having shorter SOV trips will be more likely to divert SOV travel to bicycle-like modes. The estimates of the household’s share of diverted VMT, average trip length of diverted VMT are applied elsewhere to reduce DMVT and increase bike trips. Zero vehicle households are not allowed to divert SOV travel. <a href="conceptprimer.html#census-pums"><span style="color:green">Census PUMS</span></a> data is used to estimate the models.</p>

<p>The <a href="conceptprimer.html#powertrain"><span style="color:green">powertrains</span></a>, fuels, and associated emissions datasets for all modeled <a href="#vehicle-group"><span style="color:green">vehicle groups</span></a> are among the most complex inputs used in VisionEval. Default datasets are included in the VisionEval installer to simplify this for the user. The user can use these defaults or develop their own data that matches the VisionEval input requirements. It is anticipated that different datasets will be developed by users that can be shared with the VisionEval community. For example, one package may represent a base scenario of federal vehicle, fuel, and emission standards, while another package represents the California zero-emissions vehicle (ZEV) rules and low carbon fuel for the home location’s <a href="conceptprimer.html#car-service"><span style="color:green">car service</span></a>.</p>
<p>The model looks in household vehicle sales tables indexed by <a href="#vehicle-type"><span style="color:green">vehicle type</span></a> and age to determine the probability of each powertrain in that sales year, along with its associated fuel efficiency and other attributes. Each household vehicle is assigned attributes consistent with these probabilities. In some cases electric vehicles (EVs) are replaced by plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) if household VMT and residential charging limitations exist.</p>
<p>The <a href="conceptprimer.html#powertrain"><span style="color:green">powertrain</span></a> mix of non-household vehicle groups – car service, commercial service, transit, and heavy trucks – is applied to VMT (rather than individual vehicles) in the scenario year (rather than sales year). There is some input adjustment for average vehicle age and commercial <a href="#vehicle-type"><span style="color:green">vehicle type</span></a> share.</p>
<p>Fuels for each vehicle groups can rely on the package defaults, or use one of two input options. The user can either provide a composite <a href="conceptprimer.html#carbon-intensity"><span style="color:green">carbon intensity</span></a> representing all gallons of fuel used for that vehicle group, or provide fuel mix shares (base fuel mix, biofuel blend proportions), combined with package default lifecycle (well-to-wheels) carbon intensity for the individual fuels. The resulting carbon intensity per gallon are applied to gallons generated from VMT and vehicle fuel efficiency assumptions. Adjustments to fuel efficiency due to reduced speeds due to congestion as well as ITS operational programs (e.g., <a href="conceptprimer.html#speed-smoothing"><span style="color:green">speed smoothing</span></a>) and <a href="conceptprimer.html#ecodrive"><span style="color:green">EcoDrive</span></a> programs.</p>

As a result, PHEVs do not exist other than household vehicles, instead PHEVs are represented as miles driven in HEVs and miles in EVs.</p>

<p>Congestion, only calculated on urbanized roads (a subset of <a href="conceptprimer.html#metropolitan-area"><span style="color:green">metropolitan area</span></a> roads, requires estimating and combining together the VMT of all <a href="#vehicle-group"><span style="color:green">vehicle groups</span></a>.

<p>Two adjustments are made in response to household budgets. <a href="conceptprimer.html#vehicle-ownership-costs"><span style="color:green">Vehicle ownership costs</span></a> are calculated and an adjustment is made to the number of household owned autos if the costs are greater than switching to a ‘High’ level <a href="conceptprimer.html#car-service"><span style="color:green">car service</span></a>, where available (subject to input limits on <a href="conceptprimer.html#car-service"><span style="color:green">car service</span></a> substitutability). <a href="conceptprimer.html#vehicle-ownership-costs"><span style="color:green">Vehicle ownership costs</span></a> include financing, depreciation, insurance (unless in <a href="conceptprimer.html#pay-as-you-drive"><span style="color:green">PAYD program</span></a>), annual registration fees, and residential parking fees.</p>
<p>Additionally, in order to respond to pricing policies and energy costs, VisionEval imposes an operating cost budget limitation. Household VMT is constrained such that annual <a href="conceptprimer.html#vehicle-operating-costs"><span style="color:green">vehicle operating costs</span></a> must stay below a maximum share of annual household income, or budget limit. A household-specific average annual vehicle operating costs is first calculated, including out-of-pocket per mile costs for each household owned and car service vehicles used by the household, as well as time-equivalent cost (input <a href="conceptprimer.html#access-time"><span style="color:green">access times</span></a>, estimates of VMT at congested speeds, and <a href="conceptprimer.html#value-of-time"><span style="color:green">value of time</span></a> input). Vehicle operating costs determine the proportional split of VMT across household vehicles. Out-of-pocket costs include the energy, maintenance, repair, &amp; tires, <a href="conceptprimer.html#road-use-taxes"><span style="color:green">road use taxes</span></a> (including <a href="conceptprimer.html#ev-surcharge"><span style="color:green">EV surcharge</span></a> and optional calculation of fee to fully recover road costs), work/non-work parking, <a href="conceptprimer.html#pay-as-you-drive"><span style="color:green">PAYD insurance</span></a>, input share of carbon and other <a href="conceptprimer.html#social-costs"><span style="color:green">social costs</span></a>, as well as <a href="conceptprimer.html#car-service"><span style="color:green">car service</span></a> fees by the household.

<p>VisionEval is designed to be easy to install, run, and summarize, even when comparing scores of different scenarios. It produces consistent and detailed performance metrics. The user can modify the metrics produced by the model or define their own from data exported from the model. There are also several ways to think about validation of the model within the VisionEval mindset. These topics are explored in this chapter.</p>

</h3>
<p>VisionEval is implemented entirely in the <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R statistical language</a> and operates on recent versions of Microsoft Windows. All development work is done there, although macOS and Linux versions are usually distributed. A fully self-contained installer for the more recent production release of VisionEval can be found on the <a href="https://visioneval.org/category/download.html">download page</a>. It permits installation of the full VisionEval platform, to include example data, even behind firewalls that prevent access to R Project and GitHub repositories.</p>
<p>Once installed the user assembles data into a <a href="https://github.com/VisionEval/VisionEval/blob/master/api/VE_Training_March_13-14_2019/VE_Training.md#12-basic-structure-of-model-system">standard directory structure</a>. Once the <a href="https://github.com/VisionEval/VisionEval/blob/master/api/VE_Training_March_13-14_2019/VE_Training.md#17-basic-model-setup">model run script</a> is customized by the user it is typically run from a command prompt. Running it in this manner allows several different scenarios to be run at the same time with minimal user interaction. The results can then be mined or visualized using a variety of VisionEval and third-party products. Some users use <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">R Shiny</a> or similar interactive environments for summarizing and visualizing the output from VisionEval. Such an environment is especially useful when comparing key metrics from a large number of scenarios.</p>

<p>VisionEval generates a large set of performance metrics at varying summary levels. Several pre-defined metrics are compiled for mobility, economic, land use, environmental, and energy categories in each model run. They can be tabulated for individual scenarios or compared to other scenarios, as well as visualized using a variety of tools.</p>
<p>The intermediate data generated during the various VisionEval module steps can be compiled as performance metrics, both in absolute and per-capita terms and at various geographies. Traditional transportation network metrics such as VMT, vehicle and person hours of travel, and total delay are easily compiled by overall or focused areas within the model. Likewise, emission estimates and fuel consumption are tabulated. These can be viewed in standard reports or in <code>VEScenarioManager</code> files, especially when comparing such values between scenarios.</p>
<p>One example of a set of region-wide performance metrics used by Oregon DOT includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobility
<ul>
<li>Daily per capita VMT</li>
<li>Annual walk trips per capita</li>
<li>Daily Bike trips per capita</li>
</ul>

<li>Annual all vehicle delay per capita (hours)</li>
<li>Daily household parking costs</li>

<p>Most of the data generated during a VisionEval model run can be exported (using <a href="https://github.com/VisionEval/VisionEval-Dev/blob/development/sources/tools/exporter.R">exporter.R</a>) if desired for further analyses. The user can then mine and visualize the data using a variety of open source and proprietary tools. This provides the user with considerable flexibility for creating more detailed statistics than those provided by the program. These VisionEval outputs might further serve as inputs to other models (e.g., emissions models, economic impact models) and visualization tools, and compilation of additional performance metrics.</p>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">3.8.4</span> Validation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#validation"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Setting up the model includes the steps required to apply the model for a given study. It is somewhat related to validation, both for informing what types of studies that VisionEval are appropriately sensitive to and interpreting the results. See the Getting Started page on the wiki for an overview of getting started initially.</p>
<p>Validation is the assessment of a model’s suitability for its intended purpose, often informed by comparisons against information not used in its original development. In traditional transportation planning models the comparison of observed versus modeled link flows is often a key component of validation. VisionEval is a data-driven model in that most of its inputs values are exogenously defined rather than emergent behavior from complex mathematical equations. Its aggregate representation of travel demand dictates that it be validated at the same level, with an emphasis on a wider number of comparisons than many traditional models.</p>
<p>The metric used in validation can range from relatively few, such as per-capita mobility estimates (e.g., VMT and VHT by mode), to a large number of more detailed targets. Examples of the latter include comparisons to external sources (e.g., HPMS data, DMV data), sensitivity tests of key variables, and comparison to comparable communities. An example of detailed validation criteria <a href="">used by the Oregon DOT</a> provides examples of these targets.</p>
<p>There are several options for making adjustments in order to calibrate and validate the models. These adjustments vary in difficulty, and the most appropriate approach varies by module. From easiest to most difficult the options for making adjustments are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Self-calibration:</em> Several of the modules are self-calibrating in that they automatically adjust calculations to match input values without intervention by the user.[Selected value should be validated to confirm the calculations are done correctly]</li>
<li>
<em>Adjustment of model inputs:</em> Some modules allow the user to optionally enter data that can be used to adjust the models to improve their match to observed conditions.</li>
<li>
<em>Model estimation data</em>: Several modules use data specific to the region where the model is deployed, such as household synthesis. Functions within each module generate cross-tabulations required from these data. <a href="conceptprimer.html#census-pums"><span style="color:green">Census PUMS</span></a> data from Oregon were used to develop the original models, and should be replaced with PUMS data for the modeled area.</li>
<li>
<em>Model estimation scripts:</em> An advanced user or developer can make adjustments to the model code itself in order to facilitate better matching observed local behavior or patterns. This, of course, is the most difficult option and opens up potential for significant errors, but it is possible for users that know what they are doing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main validation targets have historically included household income, vehicle ownership, vehicle miles of travel, and fuel consumption. The number of workers and drivers within each geography have recently become more widely used. These statistical comparisons can be made for the modeled area as a whole or for large geographies nested within them (e.g., Azones, Mareas). Sensitivity tests should be performed to evaluate the reasonableness (eg. correct direction and magnitude) of the VisionEval output estimates. Comparable community applications of VisionEval may also provide a reasonableness check that the model is functioning appropriately.</p>
<p>Note that HPMS definition of VMT differs from that used in VisionEval. VisionEval reports on all household travel regardless of where it occurs, and adds Commercial vehicle and Heavy Duty Truck and Bus travel on MPO roads. HPMS reports vehicular travel of all modes on roads within the MPO boundary.</p>

<p>Car services are a specific mode used in VisionEval models treated as vehicles available to the household. Car services can be considered a synonym for popular ride-sharing services provided by mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) companies. VisionEval distinguishes between two levels of car service, categorized as “high” or “low” level service. Users can define different attributes for each level of car service. Notably, households in areas with a “high” level of car service, car service will be competitive with vehicle ownership. Users can define the car service substitution probability.</p>

</h3>
<p>Car services include taxis, car sharing services (e.g. Car-To-Go, Zipcar), and future automated taxi services. A high car service level is one that has vehicle access times (time to walk between car and origin or final destination) that are competitive with private car use. High level of car service is considered to increase household car availability similar to owning a car. Low level car service, approximates current taxi service does not have competitive access time and is not considered as increasing household car availability.</p>

The samples are anonymized by assigning each to a Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) of 100,000 or more households. Several multi-dimensional summaries used in model estimation are gleaned from the PUMS that cannot be obtained from other Census data. Data indexed along these multiple dimensions permit the PUMS data to be fused with travel survey data and to create synthetic populations.
ACS PUMS data from 2005-19 in annual increments can be accessed from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/microdata.html">PUMS website</a>. Data from 1996-2004 can be <a href="https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/pums/">accessed separately</a>.</p>

<p>A synthetic measure that divides the total arterial and freeway lane-miles (i.e., the sum of the length in miles times the number of lanes for each distinct roadway segment) by the sum of the estimated trip lengths for all households. This calculation is carried out for each Marea and year. Thus, it is a measure that only applies in metropolitan areas defined in the model. This value is calculated in the <code>AssignRoadMiles</code> module and is used in several other modules.

<p>This includes costs for roadway expansion, other modernization projects, preservation, operations, maintenance and administration. VisionEval calculates an average mileage tax for household vehicles needed to make up any differences in the cost of constructing, maintaining, and operating roadways from the revenues from fuel taxes and pricing schemes (e.g., VMT taxes, congestion taxes). The latter are calculated based on assumptions about fuel consumption (a function of total daily VMT) and fuel efficiency. While VisionEval adds this to the <a href="#auto-operating-costs">auto operating costs</a> of households it is important to note that such costs might not be passed on by governments in future years as assumed by VisionEval. The road costs and revenues are reconciled in the <code>BalanceRoadCostsAndRevenue</code> module in the <code>VETravelPerformance</code> package.

<p>A mixed use development or neighborhood is one that includes residential and non-residential land uses in close proximity to one another, allowing for pedestrian access to many desired goods and services. Such places are walkable,“bikeable,” and encourage a local economy and strong social connections. From a transportation perspective such places are distinguished by their high degree of accessibility using non-motorized modes (active transport).
In VisionEval the proportion of each Bzone that falls into this category can either be specified by the user or calculated by the program. If the latter a random sampling from an asserted distribution is used to define whether a household is in a mixed-use area. The density of the enclosing Bzone weights the probability of a household being so classified (i.e., the higher the density the higher probability of being assigned to a mixed-use neighborhood). These calculations are carried on in the <code>CalculateUrbanMixMeasure</code> module of the <code>VEHouseholds</code> package.

<p>The average cost of auto ownership is calculated based upon vehicle type (automobile, light truck) and age using typical cost figures from AAA data. The cost per mile is estimated by dividing the average cost by the household daily VMT estimates produced by the model. A depreciation model is used to adjust this cost based upon the vehicle type, age, and annual miles driven (daily VMT converted into annual miles). The ownership costs represent the full costs of ownership, to include maintenance, tires, depreciation, fuel, insurance, etc.Auto ownership is adjusted when the per-mile cost of owning a car is higher than car service (mobility services) when the latter has high availability. This adjustment is made in the <code>AdjustVehicleOwnership</code> module.
