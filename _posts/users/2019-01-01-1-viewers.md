A benefit of using strategic planning models is that they enable a large number of scenarios to be evaluated. This provides planners with more information about the potential consequences of future trends and the policies that might be put in place to influence those trends and their effects. This benefit also poses a challenge in regards to how to make sense of the large amounts of output data that are produced. Fortunately, the worldwide web and programming tools developed for programming web content assist with meeting the challenge and make it easier than ever to make model results available to planners and the public. Following are examples of model results visualizations that have been developed.

ODOT's scenario viewer is a web application that enables users to explore the results of modeling hundreds of scenarios in an interactive manner. Users can investigate how changing future assumptions affects outcome measures. They can also work backwards and determine what inputs are associated with outcomes they choose.

Future Builder is a web application developed for the Central Lane Scenario Planning effort. It enables the public to choose various types and levels of actions for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from light-duty vehicles, and see how those choices affect various performance measures. It also enables users to provide feedback to planners.

### <a href="http://www.dvrpc.org/choicesandvoices/" target = "_blank">Choices and Voices</a>

The Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission created a web application that allows the public to provide feedback on how the greater Philadelphia region should grow and how the transportation system for the region should be funded, managed, and improved. It provides feedback on how those choices affect various performance measures and allow users to submit their choices to planners.
